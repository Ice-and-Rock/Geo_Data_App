## A simple Typescript Project

### Built 2 hours before a quick chat with a senior engineer.
*Future plans*
- Export useEffect to another custom component ```useFetch```
- get the chart working to display data [ time => temp/pressure ]
- imporove the UI
- import more API data from a different location to compare charts
    - list chart side by side
    - create averages in seperate functions
    - Let the user know the days it was least windy from both locations
- Run a backend server to compile user data
- create CRUD server to log details of API data
